            Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
            phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
            corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
            only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

            <description summary="register shortcut key">
                The format of the shortcut key is 'Modify+Key', such as 'Ctrl+Alt+T'.
                If the format is wrong, the synthesizer will give a "format error". If the shortcut
                key is already registered,
                the compositor will give a "register error" and issue a destruction to the context.
